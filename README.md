# SimpleAlbumsList (UIKit)

## Overview
This iOS application demonstrates advanced software engineering practices in the retrieval and display of a list of albums from a mock API ([JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)). The application follows the MVVM design pattern, integrated with a repository layer, to ensure a scalable, robust, and clean architecture. A focus on separation of concerns allows for effective management of dependencies and data flow.

## What's Included

- **MVVM Design Pattern**: To create a scalable and maintainable application, separating the business logic from the view layer.

- **Repository Layer**: For data management and network logic, providing an abstraction over data sources and ensuring a single source of truth.

- **Protocol-Oriented Programming & Mock Objects**: To increase the testability of the code and to maintain a high level of software quality.

- **Unit Tests**: To ensure application reliability.

- **Swift Concurrency**: To fetch remote data, providing a more readable and safe way to write asynchronous code.

- **Error Handling**: To improve user experience and application reliability.

- **Combine Framework**: For reactive programming, ensuring smooth and responsive UI updates.
